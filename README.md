## Milestone 2: Code Setup and Issue Queue

Most importantly, keep your issue queue up to date, and focus on your code. üôÉ

Reflect on what you‚Äôve done so far. How‚Äôs it going? Are you feeling behind/ahead? What are you worried about? 
What has surprised you so far? Describe your general feelings. Be honest with yourself; this section is for you, not me.

```
    Everything is going very well right now. The most important thing is that we figured out the structure of our code and have actually started writing it.
    We‚Äôve already created the necessary classes and functions. What surprises us the most is how much simple documentation and planning helped us understand the project better.
    It turned out to be very useful to write CRC cards first and then write code based on them, since you can clearly see which classes, methods, and attributes you need.
    However, we are a bit worried about time‚Äîthere‚Äôs still a lot to do, and we don‚Äôt want to rush through the difficult parts at the last minute.
    We also want to make sure that the code we‚Äôre writing makes sense and is readable.

## Milestone 3: Virtual Check-In

Indicate what percentage of the project you have left to complete and how confident you feel. 

‚ùóÔ∏è**Completion Percentage**: `0 - 100%`

‚ùóÔ∏è**Confidence**: Describe how confident you feel about completing this project, and why. Then, describe some 
  strategies you can employ to increase the likelihood that you'll be successful in completing this project 
  before the deadline.

```
    **Replace this text with your reflection
```

## Milestone 4: Final Code, Presentation, Demo

### ‚ùóUser Instructions

In a paragraph, explain how to use your program. Assume the user is starting just after they hit the "Run" button 
in PyCharm. 

### ‚ùóErrors and Constraints

Every program has bugs or features that had to be scrapped for time. These bugs should be tracked in the issue queue. 
You should already have a few items in here from the prior weeks. Create a new issue for any undocumented errors and 
deficiencies that remain in your code. Bugs found that aren't acknowledged in the queue will be penalized.

### ‚ùóPeer Evaluation

It is important that all members of your team contribute equitably. The peer evaluation is your chance to either 
a) celebrate the great work you all did together as an effective team, or b) indicate to the instructor if a member of
your team did not contribute their fair share. Grades will be adjusted for any team member who is evaluated poorly. Your
commit history will be used as evidence, so make sure you are using git effectively!

### ‚ùóReflection

Each partner should write three to four well-written paragraphs address the following (at a minimum):
- Why did you select the project that you did?
- How closely did your final project reflect your initial design?
- What did you learn from this process?
- What was the hardest part of the final project?
- What would you do differently next time, knowing what you know now?
- How well did you work with your partner? What made it go well? What made it challenging?
